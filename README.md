Haar Cascade (Short Description)

Haar Cascade is a machine learning object detection method used to detect objects in images or video, most commonly faces.

Developed by: Paul Viola and Michael Jones (2001)

How it works:

Uses Haar-like features (simple patterns like edges, lines, and rectangles) to detect parts of an object.

Trains a cascade of classifiers to quickly eliminate non-object regions and focus on likely object areas.

Efficient for real-time detection.

Strengths: Fast, lightweight, works well for frontal face detection.

Limitations: Less accurate with rotations, different angles, or occlusions.
